# rust-datatypes

okay here we are going to review some fundamentals
Rust checks for the byte size it sends to Assenbly (guess)
of course "byte size" is used as a logical understanding ONLY - will review rust's implementation one of thess days
so it offers mechanisms to check a lot of out of range, overflow
type situations which are not easy to check and figure out in C
some things to play with, getting this right will make you a better
programmer by just using Rust instead of trying to solve just in 
context, as a C programmer, one situation at a time
